This project was created in order to satisfy the requirements of the Bootstrap Module Assignment
Starting from the Home Page, you'll find we meet the following criteria: 

--Form Creation and Layout ``found on the home page``:
Use Bootstrapâ€™s form components to create a registration form with fields for First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, and a checkbox for agreeing to terms.
Apply Bootstrap grid layout to position the First Name and Last Name fields side-by-side.
Use validation classes to ensure the Email and Password fields are required.
Add a submit button styled with btn-success.
--Table for Displaying Data ``found on the home page below the registration form``:
Create a Bootstrap table to display user data.
Hard-code sample data into the table to simulate user submissions.
Apply striped and hoverable rows to enhance readability.
Make the table responsive by wrapping it in a table-responsive div.
--Image and Button Utilities ``found on the about us page``:
Add a responsive image using the img-fluid class and place it inside a fluid container to stretch across the page.
Below the main image, add a circular image (rounded-circle).
--Create two buttons ``Found on the contact us page``:
One button should be visible on all screen sizes.
The second button should be hidden on small screens using responsive utilities (d-none and d-md-block).
--Responsive Navigation Bar ``available on every page and collapses on mobile screens``:
Build a navbar with links to Home, About, and Contact sections.
Ensure the navbar collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
Use Bootstrap utilities and components to style the navbar.
Responsiveness and Layout:
Use Bootstrap containers (container or container-fluid) to structure the layout.
Ensure that all components are responsive across different screen sizes using media queries and Bootstrap utilities.

The above criteria have been met, and comments have been added to the code in order to show where each portion of the criteria is for easy reading.
